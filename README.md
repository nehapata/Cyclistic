# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
This project is about riders of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. It analyzes how differently casual riders and annual members use the bikes. 
Riders who purchase single-day or full-day passes are casual riders and riders who purchase annual passes are annual members. 

Through this repository, I am sharing all sql codes and queries that I used to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data.

Link to detail description of the project will be provided soon.
